  "content": "# CTS Analysis Workflows\n\nSystematic workflows for analyzing Godot projects with CTS compliance focus:\n\n## Workflow 1: Signal Architecture Review\n\n**Objective:** Assess signal-first architecture compliance\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Scan all scripts for signal definitions using scan_project_signals\n2. Identify signal emission points and connection patterns\n3. Check for direct method calls that should use signals\n4. Verify signal naming follows CTS conventions (snake_case, past tense)\n5. Generate signal map artifact for visualization\n\n**Output:** Signal architecture compliance report with refactoring suggestions\n\n## Workflow 2: File Size Compliance Check\n\n**Objective:** Ensure all files comply with <500 line limit\n\n**Steps:**\n1. List all .gd files in project\n2. Check line counts against CTS threshold\n3. Identify oversized files (>450 lines warning, >500 lines error)\n4. Suggest splitting strategies for violations\n5. Track compliance percentage\n\n**Output:** File size compliance matrix with refactoring priorities\n\n## Workflow 3: Dependency Analysis\n\n**Objective:** Map dependencies and identify coupling issues\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Extract all class_name declarations\n2. Parse preload() and load() statements\n3. Map script-to-script dependencies\n4. Identify circular dependencies\n5. Calculate coupling metrics\n6. Generate dependency graph artifact\n\n**Output:** Dependency analysis with decoupling recommendations\n\n## Workflow 4: Performance Hotspot Detection\n\n**Objective:** Identify potential performance issues\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Scan for _process() and _physics_process() methods\n2. Check for nested loops and expensive operations\n3. Identify missing caching opportunities\n4. Flag synchronous I/O in critical paths\n5. Generate performance trend artifact\n\n**Output:** Performance optimization recommendations\n\n## Usage Notes\n\n- Run workflows on project milestones\n- Combine multiple workflows for comprehensive reviews\n- Use artifacts for stakeholder communication\n- Integrate into CI/CD for automated compliance checking"
