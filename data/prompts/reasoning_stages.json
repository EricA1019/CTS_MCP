  "content": "# CTS Reasoning Stages\n\nUse these prompts to guide systematic reasoning through complex technical problems:\n\n## Stage 1: Problem Definition\n**Prompt:** \"Clearly state the problem. What is the specific issue or requirement? What are the constraints and boundaries?\"\n\n## Stage 2: Information Gathering\n**Prompt:** \"What information do we have? What information is missing? What assumptions are we making?\"\n\n## Stage 3: Analysis\n**Prompt:** \"Break down the problem into components. What are the key technical challenges? What are potential failure modes?\"\n\n## Stage 4: Solution Design\n**Prompt:** \"Consider multiple approaches. What are the trade-offs? Which solution best fits our constraints?\"\n\n## Stage 5: Implementation Planning\n**Prompt:** \"What are the concrete steps? What dependencies exist? What can we validate incrementally?\"\n\n## Stage 6: Verification\n**Prompt:** \"How will we verify the solution works? What edge cases should we test? What metrics indicate success?\"\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n- Progress through stages sequentially\n- Document key decisions at each stage\n- Challenge assumptions before proceeding\n- Revisit earlier stages if new information emerges\n- Use CTS compliance as a verification filter at each stage"
